# VoxCrm-Xml-Import

Unofficial plugin to import data from CRM [VOX Developer](https://voxdeveloper.com/)  to Wordpress website and publish as html table.
Tested with Wordpress 6.5.3. Use short code "[realestate_table]" in html on the website to show the table at selected part of the page.
Plugin supports:

- import of table from one url
- displays fields: 
    1. name
    2. status_id as (DostÄ™pny, Rezerwacja, Sprzedane)
    3. area
    4. price
    5. card_link
- custom .css
- data is automatically cached for one hour and then refreshed
- data can be manually imported in setting pressing on refresh data

To install go to release page, download zip, add it manually to plugins in wordpress, turn on, configure the url and press "zapisz zmiany" (save), add short code to your page.

If you need to adjust it to your needs feel free. I can also help you with it for a small charge.
It is my very first release of software on Github so any feedback welcomed.
